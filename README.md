# PacMen_Exercise
This is a project used to demonstrate animation within bounds of the browser window. Pacman was used as the image and velocity was changed upon encountering a boundary.

## How To Run
This project can be run by forking then cloning this repository. Then simply load up the index.html file.

## Future Plans
This is my plans for the future of this project
### Adding Sound
My previous pacman exercise incorporated sound, so I would like that to bring this over to this project as well.
### Updating images properly
This project did not have the requirement to have the pacman images alternate and turn depending on the direction they are moving. I would like to get this set up so they all face the direction they are moving left to right as well as alternate between open and closed mouth.
